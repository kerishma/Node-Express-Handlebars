# WTF Burgers 

## User Story

As a user, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Instructions

In this app you are able to look at the burger menu, add new burger, devour the burger and delete the burger after devouring it.
